# Example: Enantioselective Strecker synthesis

Here, we use this example to fully desmontrate all notebooks available in PythiaCHEM:

- data analysis: data exploration, visualization, scaling
- regression-fingerprints: regression with fingerprints, data set split, ensemble models
- regression-Mordred: regression with Mordred, feature elimination techniques, data set split
- regression-DFT: regression with DFT descriptors, PCA, data set split
- classification-fingerprints: classification with fingerprints, feature exploration, synthetic data, data set split
- classification-Mordred: classification with Mordred, feature elimination and exploration, synthetic data, data set split
- classification-DFT: classification with DFT descriptors, synthetic data, data set split, interpretability
