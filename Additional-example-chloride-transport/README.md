# Addtional example - chloride transport
**Note that this example only uses two notebooks available in PythiaCHEM. For a full demonstration of all notebooks available, please refer to the 'Example-enantioselective-Strecker-synthesis' folder!**

In this example, we investigate the chloride transport activity of synthetic anion transporters. These are small molecule ligands that can bind anions and transport them across membranes operating via a mobile carrier mechanism, with therapeutic potential in ion channel-related diseases. Here, we use classification to identify whether a transporter can be considered active or inactive based on its $log(EC_{50})$ value.
