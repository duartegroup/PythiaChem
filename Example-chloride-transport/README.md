# Example - chloride transport
In this example, we investigate the chloride transport activity of synthetic anion transporters. These are small molecule ligands that can bind anions and transport them across membranes operating via a mobile carrier mechanism, with therapeutic potential in ion channel-related diseases. Here, we use classification to identify whether a transporter can be considered active or inactive based on its $log(EC_{50})$ value. 

### Notebooks:
